# AlexanderTheBot
This was my first personal project that I worked on during my first year of university.

At the time I had just been introduced to Object Orietation so dont mind the messy class hierachy too much!

The goal of this bot was to use the Discord API to produce a game that my friends and I could play in our local discord.

The game was simple, the players could roll for an item every hour or so and they could trade with eachother to collect sets of flags, each set of flags was worth a set amount of points and the goal was to have the most points at the end.

What I learned from this project is that without a good understanding of Object Orientated Ideas (What I have learnt since) the codebase becomes
super messy very quickly and this lead to it becoming a dumpster fire by the 3rd iteration. I also learnt the importance of testing as once it was live
players would find bugs which I would have to fix immediately and it ruined the flow of the game quickly.

If I was to work on this project again I would learn how to use SQL so information isnt saved on a unencrpyted text file. I would change the scope of the project
so that anyone could use the bot on their own discord server (currently limited to just the one server). I would also rebuild from the ground up with a more
stable class hierachy.
