# AlexanderTheBot
This was my first personal project that I worked on during my first year of university.

At the time I had just been introduced to Object Orietation so dont mind the messy class hierachy too much!

The goal of this bot was to use the Discord API to produce a game that my friends and I could play in our local discord.

What I learned from this project is that without a good understanding of Object Orientated Ideas (What I have learnt since) the codebase becomes
super messy very quickly and this lead to it becoming a dumpster fire by the 3rd iteration.

If I was to work on this project again I would learn how to use SQL so information isnt saved on a unencrpyted text file. I would change the scope of the project
so that anyone could use the bot on their own discord server (currently limited to just the one server). I would also rebuild from the ground up with a more
stable class hierachy.
